My Thesis Work

Detecting emotions in sentences by using natural language processing and ensemble machine learning with various combiners on datasets

There is a missing folder which contains the data. A lot of my annotated sentences were contributed by researchers under the commitment that I would not share it with others. Unfortunately, this is more for show and tell --not of much practical use
